#This script attempts to provide a very quick hourly conversion for seeing available times in other
#major regions around the world. Useful for calculating meeting times - rather than the exact current time
#simply enter the desired hour in base 12 to convert, and it outputs that hour around the globe.
#Limitations: AM/PM are unknown as they are not provided so some sense of where places are located is needed
#Also daylight savings time is difficult to calculate, though a rough translation is provided - some regions may fail 
#during the transition, but 90+% of the time it should be correct.
